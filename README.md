# TODO List

A simple todo list operating on localhost, written in Python with Flask framework.

### How to use it:

1. Download this repository to your local machine.

2. Use `cd` to locate to the directory where you downloaded the code repository.

3. Open up a python environment, and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to download the dependencies.

(Not all the libraries in the requirements.txt are needed though. I developed this app under my general Flask environment
but you can create an individual virtual environment for this app, if you want to keep your working environment clean.)

4. Under your Python environment, run `python3 app.py`.

5. Open up your favourite browser and go to "http://localhost:5000".

6. And start using this to manage your tasks!
